# AutoBTransfer
Automated BT file transfer with OBEX - JavaFX
My first attempt working with BlueTooth connection..
Main goal was to build an app that listens a directory choosen by user for ENTRY_CREATE (new file, created, pasted etc.),
checks on it periodically and sends it to a previously setup BT device.
Period of checking on folder is adjustable.

ps. surely needs some more exception handling, I'm working on it
